- Visual Studio Code: My preferred IDE for database management and executing SQL queries. 
- Git & GitHub: Essential for version control and sharing SQL and analysis.
## The Analysis
Each query for this project aimed to investigate specific aspects of the data analyst job market. Here's how I approached it:

### 1. Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs
To identify the highest-paying roles, I filtered data analyst positions by average yearly salary and location, focusing on remote jobs. This query highlights the high paying opportunities in the field. 
```sql
SELECT
    job_id,
    job_title,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date,
    name AS company_name
FROM
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE 
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND 
    job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
Here's the breakdown of the top data analyst jobs in 2023:

- Wide Salary Range: Top 10 paying data analyst roles span from $184k - $650k indicating significant salary potential in the career.
- Diverse Employers: Companies like SmartAsset, Meta, and AT&T are among those offering high salaries, showing a broad interest across different industries. 
- Job Title Variety: There's a high diversity in job titles, from Data Analyst to Director of Analytics, reflecting varied roles and specializations within data analytics. 
### 2. Skills for Top Paying Jobs

To understand what skills are required for the top-paying jobs, I joined the job postings with the skills data, providing inisghts into what employers value for high-compensation roles. 
```sql
WITH top_paying_jobs AS (

SELECT
    job_id,
    job_title,
    salary_year_avg,
    name AS company_name
FROM
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE 
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND 
    job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10
)

SELECT 
    top_paying_jobs.*,
    skills
FROM top_paying_jobs
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON top_paying_jobs.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id 
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
ORDER BY salary_year_avg DESC
```
Here's the breakdown of the most demanded skills for the top 10 highest paying data analyst jobs in 2023:

## üõ†Ô∏è Skills Used on Project
Throughout this project, I applied several key skills to analyze Data Analyst job postings, extract meaningful insights, and understand the relationship between job demand, skills, and salary. Here are the three main skills I utilized:

1. Data Aggregation üìä
I used data aggregation techniques to group, summarize, and calculate metrics from job postings data. By utilizing functions like COUNT() and AVG() in SQL, I was able to aggregate information about job demand for specific skills and compute average salaries. This helped to provide a clear overview of the most requested skills and their associated salaries.

2. Creating SQL Queries üìù
A large portion of the project involved writing and optimizing SQL queries to extract relevant data from large job postings datasets. I created queries that filtered data based on specific job titles (Data Analyst) and job types (remote positions), joined multiple tables, and selected key attributes such as skill IDs, skill names, and salary details. This helped me gather and organize the data required for analysis.

3. Deriving Insights from Queries üîç
After executing the SQL queries, I analyzed the resulting data to draw meaningful insights about the job market. This included identifying the most in-demand skills, comparing salary trends for different skill sets, and understanding the factors that contribute to higher-paying Data Analyst roles. I used these insights to answer critical questions about the data, like which skills are most valuable for securing top-paying jobs.
## Conclusion
### üìö What I Learned - Insights

Throughout this project, I gained valuable insights into the skills and salary trends within the Data Analyst job market. By analyzing remote job postings, I learned how to identify in-demand skills and their correlation with higher salaries. Here are some key takeaways from my experience:

1. Understanding Key Data Analyst Skills üßë‚Äçüíª
I learned that SQL, Excel, Python, Power BI, and Tableau are among the most commonly required skills for data analyst roles. Each of these skills plays a crucial part in data manipulation, visualization, and analysis. By understanding which skills are in demand, I can prioritize my learning and improve my marketability as a Data Analyst.

2. The Role of Advanced Tools and Technologies üîß
Beyond the basics, I discovered that more specialized tools like PySpark, BigQuery, and Snowflake are highly sought after and command top salaries. These technologies are particularly valuable for handling large-scale data and performing complex analyses, making them highly relevant for advanced data professionals.

3. Salary Trends and What Drives Them üíµ
By analyzing the salary data, I found that skills such as PySpark, Bitbucket, and Bitbucket are associated with some of the highest-paying roles. Interestingly, technical expertise in cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud (BigQuery) also drives salary increases, indicating the growing importance of cloud technologies in data-driven industries.

4. Demand vs. Salary üìà
I gained a deeper understanding of how the demand for a particular skill correlates with salary levels. While some skills may have high demand, the correlation with salary can vary based on the complexity of the tasks associated with those skills. For example, advanced skills in machine learning and cloud computing tend to have a higher salary attachment due to their complexity.

5. Strategic Skill Development üéØ
From this project, I learned that focusing on a combination of foundational and advanced skills can lead to more lucrative opportunities. Skills like Python, SQL, and Tableau are essential for entry to mid-level roles, while more specialized skills in cloud computing, machine learning, and big data technologies are key for higher-paying, senior-level positions.

6. The Importance of Staying Up-to-Date üîÑ
The landscape of data analytics is constantly evolving. The demand for new tools and technologies requires continuous learning to stay competitive. Through this project, I understood the need to regularly update my skill set to align with industry demands, ensuring long-term career growth and job security.
### Closing Thoughts
This project has been an invaluable learning experience, allowing me to apply my skills in SQL and data analysis to real-world job market trends. By analyzing remote Data Analyst roles, I was able to uncover which skills are in highest demand and correlate them with salary expectations, offering a clear roadmap for career growth. The insights gained will not only guide my own learning path but also help others make informed decisions about which skills to prioritize for future opportunities. As the data landscape continues to evolve, staying informed and adaptable will be key to success in the industry.
